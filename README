This is simply a playground application - to be able to try out different approaches with Backbone.js

Some agenda items:
1. create a single page app experience
2. use asp.net mvc controller/actions to support the backbone.sync
3. alternatively, use amplify sessionStorage (for demo purposes - so the data is cleared after each session)
4. use Derick Baileys modelbinding and marionette libraries to show binding and view switching 
5. incorporate validation - rails style (going to try https://github.com/n-time/backbone.validations )

This 'project' is a work in progess'
