This is simply a playground application - to be able to try out different approaches with Backbone.js

Some agenda items:
1. create a single page app experience
2. use asp.net mvc controller/actions to support the backbone.sync
3. alternatively, use amplify sessionStorage (for demo purposes - so the data is cleared after each session)
4. use Derick Baileys modelbinding and marionette libraries to show binding and view switching 
5. incorporate validation - rails style (going to try https://github.com/n-time/backbone.validations )

Main example one:  localhost  or localhost/Index
to use CRUD with asp.net mvc.
works, but then when trying to switch between 'add' and 'edit' in same element, ran into problems with 'zombies' (see http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/15/zombies-run-managing-page-transitions-in-backbone-apps/ )

This led to needing a view manager.  That said, the new (and timely) marionette library uses a composite app approach with view switching (see http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/12/12/composite-js-apps-regions-and-region-managers/ )

This 'project' is a work in progess'
